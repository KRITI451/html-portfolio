<h2>Hi, I'm Kriti, a passionate first-year tech student with a keen interest in  web development. I thrive on learning new technologies and applying them in real-world projects. Currently, I'm honing my skills in web dev and exploring opportunities in content creation and graphic designing through my internship at Muskan NGO.

When I'm not coding or designing, I enjoy listining songs, watching web series and cooking :)

Feel free to connect with me on mentioned platform.</h2>
